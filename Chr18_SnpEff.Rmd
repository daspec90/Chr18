####Preliminaries

Exploratory analysis of SnpEff output indicated that SnpEff ANN= data is appended to the INFO column of the .vcf file (column #8), making it quite unwieldy. But I should be able to use dplyr to search for specific strings (variant calls) that have been added by SnpEff.

####SnpEff analysis

N.B. I downloaded the latest version of SnpEff into my home directory. Then within the snpEff home directory I ran this command from the Terminal:

`java -Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar mm10 Chr18/Chr18.all.vcf  > Chr18.all.ann.vcf`

This (quite rapidly) generated the Chr18.all.ann.vcf file.
N.B. Chr2.all.vcf was 18.9Mb, Chr2.all.ann.vcf is 71Mb, so this just adds additional columns of information. Then I started this new R_project (Chr18) after creating a git repository, and I moved the Chr18.all.ann.vcf file to the project's directory.
